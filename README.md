Japanese House of Representatives Election, District and Municipality Codes

To merge municipality-level results of Japanese House of Representatives elections with other municipality-level data (e.g., demographics and local finance statistics), we need to know which municipalities (with official municipality codes) are included in each electoral district and whether a municipality belongs to more than one electoral district. 

I made a file (JHRcodes.csv) a long time ago. My file only includes informaion up to the 2000 Lower House election. 

Kuniaki Nemoto kindly sent me an updated file (Municipal Codes for HoR Oct 25 2017.xlsx), which includes information up to the 2017 Lower House election. Thank you, Nemoto-san!
